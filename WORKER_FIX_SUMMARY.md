# Worker Error Fixes

## üêõ Errors Fixed

### Error 1: SQLAlchemy Relationship Error
```
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: When initializing mapper Mapper[Document(documents)], 
expression 'Chat' failed to locate a name ('Chat')
```

**Cause**: The `Document` model has a relationship to `Chat`, but the worker wasn't importing the `Chat` model, so SQLAlchemy couldn't resolve the relationship.

**Fix**: Import all related models in `worker/tasks.py`:
```python
# Before:
from app.models.document import Document, Page, Chunk

# After:
from app.models.document import Document, Page, Chunk, Figure
from app.models.chat import Chat, Message, Citation
```

### Error 2: UnboundLocalError
```
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'document' where it is not associated with a value
```

**Cause**: In the exception handler, we tried to access `document.status` but if the error occurred during the initial query, `document` was never assigned.

**Fix**: Initialize `document = None` at the start and check before accessing:
```python
# Before:
def ingest_document(doc_id: str, user_id: str):
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        document = db.query(Document)...
        ...
    except Exception as e:
        document.status = "error"  # Might not exist!

# After:
def ingest_document(doc_id: str, user_id: str):
    db = SessionLocal()
    document = None  # Initialize
    try:
        document = db.query(Document)...
        ...
    except Exception as e:
        if document:  # Check before using
            document.status = "error"
```

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### File: `worker/tasks.py`

**Line 9-10**: Added missing imports
```python
from app.models.document import Document, Page, Chunk, Figure
from app.models.chat import Chat, Message, Citation
```

**Line 30**: Initialize document variable
```python
document = None  # Initialize to avoid UnboundLocalError
```

**Line 137-140**: Check document exists before updating
```python
if document:  # Only update if document was found
    document.status = "error"
    document.error_message = str(e)
    db.commit()
```

## üß™ Testing

After the fixes, upload a PDF and watch the worker process it:

```bash
# Watch worker logs in real-time
docker compose logs -f worker

# Expected output:
# - Extracting text from filename.pdf
# - Saving X pages
# - Chunking text
# - Created X chunks
# - Generating embeddings (this takes time on first run)
# - Saving chunks to database
# - Document abc-123 ingestion complete
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Upload a PDF** at http://localhost:3000/library
2. **Worker should process it** - status will change from "Queued" ‚Üí "Ready"
3. **First run will be slow** - BGE-M3 model downloads (~900MB, 5-10 min)
4. **Subsequent uploads will be faster** - model is cached

## üìä Complete Pipeline Status

‚úÖ Frontend authentication working  
‚úÖ PDF upload to MinIO working (after .env fix)  
‚úÖ Job enqueuing to Redis working  
‚úÖ Worker picking up jobs working  
‚úÖ SQLAlchemy models resolved  
‚úÖ Error handling improved  
‚è≥ Awaiting BGE-M3 model download on first run

**Status**: Worker fixes applied, ready to process documents!
